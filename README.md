# Code Golf: Yay!
This is a repo for competitions or just fun things having to do with code golf!

### Directory Structure
* Files will be prefixed with either `c-`, `j-`, or `m-` to indicate the contributor or player
* If there's more than one contributor just add two letters before the `-`, for instance `mc-tek.html`
* Files and directories will use `kebab-case`
* Competitions will be placed in a single directory
* Files will not be named `main.js`, name them whatever the subject of the golfing is

### Designating a Task
* `README.md` files will be used to designate tasks
* Tasks marked with `CLEAN` shouldn't produce any globals except for the global being executed
