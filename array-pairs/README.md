# Array Pairs - CLEAN
A function exposed to the global scope with types:
```ts
arrayPairs(ary0: Array<T>, ary1: Array<T>): Array<T>
```
returns an Array consisting of elements that both arrays have, in pairs.

Note: Cole and Joshua came up with the same solution, so for the sake of variety, Joshua entered a different algorithm.
